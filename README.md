wkportal
========

A basic django project to frontend some WK data and other (hopefully) useful stuff

This is a primarily a semi-useful test playground for me to learn and practice django. It also will hopefully get me into the habit of making at least one commit per day into my own personal projects.

For anyone else, it is probably less useful unless you are a wanikani user.

It's final form will hopefully be a portal that I can use to link to other services I am hosting, get a semi-recent list of reviews to do, get some exposure to the language I am learning, and collect useful and fun sentences that I can use to study.
